# namaste

This is a Go language port of Namaste (Name as Text) library inspired by the Python
implementation of [namaste](https://github.com/mjgiarlo/namaste) which in turn was 
ported from [Perl implementation](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Namaste).

## Go Package

The Go package seeks to mimic the Python implementation as much as possible

## Command Line implementation

The command line implementation exercises the Go package and seeks to be largely
command line compatible with the Python implementation.

## Command line package

The command line implementation's purpose is to exercise the Go package
and test practical usage.  It is intended to be command line compatible
with the Python implementation.

## Planned Extensions

There are a few things that extend existing namaste implementations. The
first is the integration of alternatives for disc storage (e.g. Amazon S3
and Google Cloud Storage).  The other is the ability to output the nameste
elements as a JSON object.
