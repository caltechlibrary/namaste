# namaste

This is a Go language port of Namaste (Name as Text) library inspired by the Python
implementation of [namaste](https://github.com/mjgiarlo/namaste) which in turn was 
ported from [Perl implementation](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Namaste).

## Go Package

The Go package seeks to mimic the Python implementation as much as possible

## Command Line implementation

The command line implementation exercises the Go package and seeks to be largely
command line compatible with the Python implementation.
