# Namaste

Namaste (i.e. "NAMe AS TExt") is a file naming convention to support primitive directory-level metadata tags 
exposed directly via filenames. As such, Namaste tags greet visitors who request a directory listing 
(e.g., Linux 'ls') with a glimpse of what the directory holds. This approach can be readily implemented
as a library or as a command line tool. Prior implementations exist in Perl and Python.
